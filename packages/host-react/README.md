# @homeslate/host-react

The homeslate web shell: a routed app over `@homeslate/editor` and
`@homeslate/display`, a Google runtime wired to the homeslate API, and the
debounced persist helper.

```tsx
import { HomeslateApp } from "@homeslate/host-react";

// Inside your provider tree (DesignSystemProvider / IconProvider / LayerProvider):
<HomeslateApp productName="Homeslate" />;
```

Pass `apiBaseUrl` when the API is on another origin, and `widgetRegistry` to
override the widget registry used by the editor and kiosk.

## Routes

`HomeslateApp` wires a `BrowserRouter` with four pages:

- `/` — `DisplayListPage`: lists displays, flags ones with a viewer passcode, and
  creates new ones.
- `/edit/:id` — `EditorPage`: display management with **Views**, **Settings**, and
  **Theme** tabs.
- `/edit/:id/views/:viewId` — `ViewEditorPage`: the per-view canvas editor
  (`@homeslate/editor`).
- `/d/:publicId` — `KioskPage`: polls the public document and, when the display
  has a passcode, prompts for the 4-digit PIN before rendering.

Compose the exported pages yourself for different chrome or routing, and read
`useHomeslateHost()` for the config.

## Display management

- **Views** (`ViewsPanel`) add, rename, reorder, hide, and delete the views in a
  document, using the `addView` / `removeView` / `moveView` / `patchView` helpers
  from `@homeslate/display/canvas`.
- **Settings** (`DisplaySettingsPanel`) covers auto-rotate, sticky notes, alarms
  (`AlarmListEditor` from `@homeslate/widgets`), voice commands, holiday effects,
  and the viewer passcode.
- **Theme** reuses `ThemeEditor` from `@homeslate/editor`.

The viewer passcode is set through `setDisplayPasscode(baseUrl, id, pin | null)`,
which `PATCH`es `/api/displays/:id`. The PIN itself is hashed server-side and is
never returned; the owner-facing record only carries `passcodeEnabled`.

## Data helpers

`useDisplayDocument(baseUrl, id)` loads a display record, exposes
`document` / `passcodeEnabled` / save state, and persists edits with a debounced
`PUT`. The lower-level `getJson`, `postJson`, `putJson`, `patchJson`,
`getPublicDocument`, `publicDocumentUrl`, and `setDisplayPasscode` are exported
for hosts that build their own data layer.
